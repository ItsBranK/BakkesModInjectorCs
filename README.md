## About

BakkesModInjector Community Edition is as a replacement for the original BakkesModInjectorCpp that's provided by Bakkes.
BakkesMod itself is the exact same, so you will keep all your files and get all the latest updates. The only difference is the injector.
Created by ItsBranK (me), along with the contributors SimpleAOB and Aberinkula/Megasplat;
this project was created to provide users with a more user friendly, stable, and feature packed injector for daily users of BakkesMod.

Some of the new features in this edition are

- A new redesigned user friendly interface
- Detailed process and injection status events
- Collapsable changelog box with the latest BakkesMod news
- View your installed plugins and uninstall them
- Multiple injection modes, Timeout, Manual, and Always Injected
- Crash log exporter, exports all log files and crash reports into a single zip file
- Both reinstall and uninstall BakkesMod in the Settings tab
- View your Rocket League, Injector, and BakkeMod versions in the About tab
