## About

BakkesModInjector Community Edition is as a replacement for the original injector that's provided by default with BakkesMod.
Created by ItsBranK (me), along with the contributors SimpleAOB and Aberinkula/Megasplat;
this project was made to provide daily BakkesMod users with a more user friendly, feature packed, stable experience.
BakkesMod itself is the exact same, so you will keep all your files and get all the latest updates.

Some of the new features in this edition are:

- A redesigned user friendly interface.
- Detailed process and injection status events in the Home tab.
- Collapsable changelog box with the latest BakkesMod news.
- View your installed plugins and have the option to uninstall them.
- Multiple injection modes, Timeout and Manual.
- Crash log exporter, exports all log files and crash reports into a single zip file.
- Both reinstall and uninstall BakkesMod in the Settings tab.
- View your Rocket League, Injector, and BakkeMod versions in the About tab.

## Download

The latest version can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/ItsBranK/BakkesModInjectorCs/releases), simply extract exe from the zip file and run the program.
